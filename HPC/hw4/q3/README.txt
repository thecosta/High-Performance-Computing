For this exercise I used an LU decomposition. 
The LU decomposition algorithm was taken from http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/doolittle-algorithm-lu-decomposition/.
No OpenMP or threading was used, since it caused the matrix inversion to run slower. 
The matrix size I used to test out my program was 1000. 
The average time I got for such inversion was around 2.5 seconds.

Run make to create binary file for the program.
